"# Harmonic-Oscillators" 
Project studying the Lennard-Jones potential of N atoms.

Requires: unittest, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

Current status: Working for 3 atoms, including animations. Occasionally stalls due to iterations not running long enough. Project has focused on random motion of 3 atoms to achieve proper potential, but it is far too slow. Currently working on way to employ Euler's Method to solve potential IVP
