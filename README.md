"# Harmonic-Oscillators" 
Project studying the Lennard-Jones potential of N atoms.

Requires: unittest, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

Current status: Working for N atoms. Tends to run slow for >5 or for >5000 steps. Need to work on PutInPymol and FuncAnimation as those are not optimal right now.
